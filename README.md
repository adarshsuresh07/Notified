## Motivation

The initial motive behind the idea was to create a space dedicated for sharing career openings for the students of our class. When shared through mediums like Whatsapp group, there is a much greater chance of getting ignored and at some point these messages gets piled up and students end up in no more paying attention to that. In addition, we felt a need to get notified about the openings of our preference and keep track of the application and wish list status of the opportunities.

## Basic concept

Lets now familiarise Notified a bit more clearly. You'll find 4 different stacks for opportunity management on the dashboard once you've successfully set up your account :

 - ***Opportunity stack*** : aka main stack, this is a global stack that contains all active opportunities added by users. It gets updated with every new opportunity that you add to the system.
 - ***Todo stack*** : aka wish stack, every user gets a private copy of todo stack to own and you can pool this by picking those openings from the main stack which you wish to apply or look into.
 - ***Applied stack*** : This is the place where you move the openings which you've applied ( yes, an end to this : "Dude, I get the link, I give my name..don't even know which all I've applied and what I've to wait for") and yes, it is also private to the user.
 - ***Expired stack*** : A place where an opening from your main stack gets piled up when its no longer active.
